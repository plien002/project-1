    <h2>Fall Craft Fair 2025</h2><br>
    <p>plyney's plushies was established in January of 2024. The owner and creator of the business, Lauren, started creating handmade stuffed animals in 2023 with nothing more than a needle and thread. Once she recieved her first embroidery machine from her grandmother, she quickly started making higher quality stuffed animals and started selling them in early 2024. Since then, Lauren has opened an Etsy business, and has sold at craft fairs and as a consignment artist at Dock 6 Pottery. You can find her stuff in the gallery in St. Anthony Village today. She also takes custom orders, primarily from friends and family. You can email her and ask about her custom orders at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=plyneysplushies@gmail.com&su=&body=">plyneyplushies@gmail.com</p>
